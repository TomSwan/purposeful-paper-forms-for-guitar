Like most, I love my iPad, my laptops, my smart-azz phone and all my other devices. I've even gotten used to reading guitar scores on my tablet and not printing them out first.

But my early fantasies of doing away with paper never morphed into reality, and I've found paper copies of the blank sheet-music and other forms included with this repository especially valuable to my number one hobby, banging around on the guitar. 

Maybe it's just me, but I've always thought that just by writing something down, whatever it is, I learn the subject better. I know these forms have helped me improve as a musician.
